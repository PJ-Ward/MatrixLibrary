PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE:
        Perform addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, and transpose operations on matrices
        
FILES:
        README.md: you are here
        
FILES:
        matrix.cpp: contains class Matrix with functions to perform operations listed above, and main includes the code to execute the test program
        
FILES:
        matrix.c: contains functions to perform operations listed above, and main includes the code to execute the test program
        
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
        The test program equation is already set up in main for both files
        
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
        If modifying that, matrices must be 1d arrays with each row listed in full (ex. R1C1 R1C2 R1C3 R2C1 R2C2 R2C3 for a 2x3 matrix)
        
TESTING METHODOLOGY:
        Did basic operations and fixed whatever didnt work, until it all worked
        
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
